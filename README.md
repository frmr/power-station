power-station
=============

Trivial SPARK Ada 2014 example modelling a power station control system.

Temperature and pressure must be kept within the range [0,3]. Change in these variables is simulated by user input:
	- '+' to increment the variable
	- '-' to decrement the variable
	- '=' to leave the variable unchanged
	
Any other input is considered an error, and the program exits safely.
